OneDrive API Explorer sample code for Windows / C#

**Note: This is an older sample code project provided for example only. This
sample has been replaced by the same sample app using the official
[OneDrive SDK for .NET](https://github.com/onedrive/onedrive-sdk-csharp).**

This sample illustrates basic concepts for interacting with the OneDrive API
from a C# application.

Included in this project:

* OneDriveApiExplorer - A sample browser application that browsers the contents
  of the signed in user's OneDrive and shows the JSON structures returned by the
  API. The Api Explorer also shows you search results and how to upload files in
  various ways using the OneDriveSDK example.
* OneDriveSDK - An **example** library for interacting with OneDrive. This library
  has been replaced by the OneDrive SDK for .NET which is now available on NuGet
  or [GitHub](https://github.com/onedrive/onedrive-sdk-csharp).
