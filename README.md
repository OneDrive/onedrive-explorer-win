# onedrive-explorer-win

OneDrive API Explorer sample code for Windows / C#

**This project has moved to the official [OneDrive SDK for .NET](https://github.com/onedrive/onedrive-sdk-csharp).**

The existing code is preserved in the old-code branch for historical purposes,
however it should be used as an example only. The OneDrive Explorer sample app
is included in the OneDrive SDK repository along with additional sample apps
including a sample Universal Windows app.
